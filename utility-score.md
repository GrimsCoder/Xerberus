# Utility Score

## How does it work?&#x20;

The Utility Score is a simple scorecard that looks at the utility token provides. We score the following categories:

* Governance Utility&#x20;
  * Are governance rights part of the token utility?
  * Is a token holder already able to execute governance rights?   &#x20;
* Product Utility&#x20;
  * Can the holder use a product with this token?&#x20;
  * Is the usage right exclusive to this token?&#x20;
* Security Utility &#x20;
  * Give the token a right to profit share?&#x20;
  * Is the profit right exclusive or are their other way to get profits out of the protocol?&#x20;
  * Is the token registered in any way? &#x20;

We additionally consider the staking as token utility and if it falls under any of the above mentioned categories.

In general, we try way tokens that are system essential higher than tokens that seem more like an add-on to a product. A token utility should be considered higher when the protocol underlying it depends on the token or would not be feasible without the token economy surrounding it.

### Limitations of the current model?&#x20;

We do see limitations and weaknesses in our current scoring model. We will address these shortcomings as we develop the model in the coming months. The two most significant flaws the model currently has are the following.&#x20;

* The more utility a project team promises, the higher the score, making the model easy to manipulate.  &#x20;
* The utility scoring is currently done within the organization and without community oversight; this rating based on team discretion is a fundamental weakness.&#x20;
