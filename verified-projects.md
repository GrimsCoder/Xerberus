# Verified Projects

## How does it work?&#x20;

Any project may contact us to inform us about the wallets listed on our website or named in our research. A project that provides us with information about these wallets firsthand is listed as verified. The verified patch is a little green icon displayed beside the name.

These verified patches will become more critical as we expand the Xerberus Platform and display more information about the biggest wallets holding each token.&#x20;

To be verified, a project must provide us a list of all project's wallets and their purpose, including a short description of, e.g., a smart contract using this wallet.&#x20;

Currently verified projects are:&#x20;

* WingRiders DEX
* Smart Contract Audit Token&#x20;

### Limitations of the current model?&#x20;

We rely on self-reporting. It is possible that, in theory, a project could not report fully about all critical wallets. Also, one entity holding many small wallets is currently not within our scope to detect; therefore, a project could hide substantial amounts of tokens by using many small wallets and not declaring them. We will add other methods to our analysis to compensate for these apparent weaknesses.
