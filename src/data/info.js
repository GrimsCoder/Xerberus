      "This score shall help you to understand who is owning a token. We use the available data to process it with a new tool of mathematics, called Topological Data Analysis. With TDA we look at the shape of data and see which projects data looks similar to each other. Based on the similarity, we provide a risk score. The idea is that good projects should look alike each other and so do rug pulls.",
