    what: "We use the available data to process it with a new tool of mathematics, called Topological Data Analysis. With TDA we look at the shape of data and see which projects data looks similar to each other. Based on the similarity, we provide a risk score. The idea is that good projects should look alike each other and so do rug pulls.",

    title: "Beta Stage",
    what: "After understanding the shape of successful and failed projects we need to add a prediction element into the risk analysis. Therefore we create a public prediction market and allow broad knowledge to flow into those predictions while also avoiding closed door decisions. By combining the prediction market output with the TDA data we built a “risk universe”: a multidimensional space in which projects exist like planets. By creating this space we can now predict, like astronomers, where the objects in our space are headed.",

    output:
      "A prediction market for project researchers whose knowledge will improve risk scores significantly by providing a future dimension. Everyone can now learn about the quality of a project today, and how on what trajectory it is heading in the future.",
